MCG_compute is the package to compute MCG object candidates and UCMs, and benchmark object segmentation algorithms.

FIRST INSTALL
- Change root_dir to point to the MCG root folder (the one with the file root_dir.m, instal.m, etc.)
- Change datasets/database_root_dir to point to your PASCAL2012 folder (the one with subfolders ImageSets, JPEGImages, etc.)
- Run install.m from the root dir to add the needed paths and do some checks
- If you need to re-build the library (the script install.m will tell if needed), run build.m

USAGE INSTALL
- Each time you restart your matlab, run install.m
- If you want to avoid this, add the paths permanently

MCG USAGE
- To compute MCG candidates, see im2mcg.m (and scripts/im2mcg_all.m)
- To compute MCG UCMs, see im2ucm.m (and scripts/im2ucm_all.m)
- For demos about how to use these functions, see the 'demos' folder

EVALUATION
- See scripts/benchmark_results.m to see how to evaluate the candidates
  and compare them to the state of the art

NOTE
- Very big images (around 10 mega-pixels) make the detection of edges at scale 2
  break, so if you really need to handle big images, just use SCG ('fast' mode)

Enjoy!
